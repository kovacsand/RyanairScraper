# RyanairScraper
A python project for requesting flight ticket prices from Ryanair's website

I had problems with Ryanair's policy of changing their prices all the time, so I wanted to have a better overlook of it.
I plan to scrape data so that I can analyse it later and recognise tendencies.

First, I have to request and store the data.
For this, I use the ryanair module created by Ciarán Ó hAoláin
The module can be accessed here: https://github.com/cohaolain/ryanair-py
